          <p>GameDice and its websites, games and other applications ("we," "our" or "us") believe that your privacy is really important. This Policy describes the personally identifiable information and other data that we will collect from you through the apps and games we provide, and how we will use and when we might display such data to third parties. Your installation and/or use of these Websites/Apps and/or submission of information to us establish your consent to this Privacy Policy and the processing of your information (personal and non-personal) as described in this policy. Please don‚Äôt use the Services if you do not agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>

          <h2>Information we Collect</h2>
          <h3>1. Personal Information</h3>
          <p>The information which identifies you personally and/or can be used to contact you online or offline, such as your full name, physical address, email address, telephone number, photograph, precise geo-location information, credit card information and for some apps you may be required to share your username.</p>

          <h3>2. Non-Personal Information</h3>
          <p>The information which does not identify you and cannot be used to contact you personally. It includes your date of birth, age, ZIP code, your city, gender as well as the information about your computer and mobile device such as unique device ID, Internet Protocol (IP) address, or other persistent identifiers, and their hardware/software/firmware. It also includes usage data which identifies the browser you use, identity of other apps on device, game progress, play time, score and achievements, and URLs you visited and/or apps you used before after using our Apps.</p>

          <h2>How We Collect Information</h2>
          <p>If you sign up our services, open an account or in any other way you are required to submit information, we may collect personal and non-personal information.

If you choose to make a purchase through our Websites/Apps, we will collect your credit card information and other billing information. If you choose to send a message to another user or defined group of users through our message, chat, post or other in-game function, we may collect any Personal Information you may disclose through such means, as well as the necessary Personal Information of the user(s) you are contacting, in order to facilitate the communication (Note: we will never collect any information sent outside of the functionality of our Websites/Apps, including through emails or text messages).
